# StormShare
Currently in development.  
Stormshare is planned to be a collaborative building aid for the game Stormworks: Build and Rescue.  
Use pip install -r requirements.txt to install required modules.  
To run the server, go to the server folder and run main.py.  
The client does almost nothing, and there are no users by default, so it is useless.
